[zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions) is exactly what the name entails: it’s a powerful plugin that suggests commands as you type based on your history in the terminal.
[zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting) brings basic bash script syntax coloring support to the Zsh terminal. With this, you’ll be able to spot mistypes before running commands.
[powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) is an awesome-looking theme for Zsh which can actually make your [shell faster](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k#instant-prompt)!
